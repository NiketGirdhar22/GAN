# Denoising Diffusion Probablistic Models

Denoising Diffusion Probablistic Models belong to a class of neural networks - Generative Netwokrs

- Generative model for high-quality image synthesis
- Uses forward diffusion process
    - Incrementally adds noise to an image
    - Neural network is setup that tries to reverse the diffusion which generates image
