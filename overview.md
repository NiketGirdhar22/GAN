# Generative Advesarial Networks [GANs]

GANs belong to a class of neural networks - Generative Netwokrs

## What are types of models models?

- ***Deterministic model:***  A statistical model that determines boundaries in the observed data and uses these boundaries to make decisions or predictions.
- ***Generative model:*** Describes how a dataset is generated in terms of probablistc model and sampling from the model allows to generate new data that did not exist.
